# Projects Made Using My AI Agent
This repo is a compilation of apps and code directed by me and written by an Ai Agent I created.  The current list were all produced April to May 2025. 

My subjects and designs were complex, highly conceptual, and required very technical programming.  My goal was to write zero code myself, but only interact with AI.  Difficult as that was, it was necessary practice, for it forced me to create the agent that could actually produce what I wanted.  That is what is called "UX Design".

I used tens or hundreds of millions of tokens in the process, with contexts windows reaching 750K tokens each session; beyond ~500K or so token windows the returns were generally diminshed.

## Self Attention Analyzer with Bezier Curves
I wanted to analyze the bare self attention algorithm, meaning that no weights are learned, and see the difference made by the choice of activation function.  The page has a complete description.

## Pixel Sampling Painting App
A canvas painting app specifically designed to pick colors/textures by extracting the pixel distributions of color pallete shapes.  
Perhaps not the most user friendly app, made in less than a day, but I wanted to push the limits, and use cutting edge browser specs like the file system API to store large sample distribution data.
To use it you must activate the FS API by scrolling to the bottom of the page.  Then back at the top you first choose the shape of colors.

## Coming Soon
* The AI agent itself which I designed and directed, was written by the agent itself starting with a protocol and then producing scripts, VMs, programs, macros, and more.
* webGPU general purpose parallel processing mathematical synthesis engine
